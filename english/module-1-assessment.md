Hi there! My name is Daniel Gutierrez Muñoz. I’m 20 years old. I’m from Medellín, Colombia and I live in Belen Los Alpes. At the present time, I’m exclusively dedicated to Riwi and not engaged in any external work or studies. My complete focus is on Riwi.

My main motivation to learn English is to get a job at a foreign company. I aspire to achieve the stage where I earn in a different currency through remote work and collaborate with people from various countries.

I face two main challenges when learning English. The first one is vocabulary: As most of the content I consume is programming English content I don’t feel I have a wide set of words to discuss common everyday things. The second challenge I face is time distribution: To be honest, becoming part of Riwi has made me been through the process of getting used to the schedule and I’m still figuring out when to dedicate time to learning English. However, with this assessment I made the decision of doing something I’ve wanted to do long ago. 

I will use an app called Anki. This app basically allows us to apply the best study techniques proven by science which are active recall and space repetition.

My idea will consists of three faces: Gathering, studying and applying. The gathering face will be when I listen to any word or phrase that I didn’t know before and I will add it to Anki.

Then, the studying face will take place in the first 30 minutes after getting up in the morning. I will use the gathered content within Anki and apply the techniques mentioned before. I will begin with three times a week at this face.

And the last and probably most important face… which is applying ... will take place at Riwi forcing myself to speak in English with my classmates.

Just to mention, this is the plan I thought of when I was writing up the script for this assessment. However, I will iterate over it trying to make it better to fit my schedule.

I hope the latter answers the time distribution question for you. Thank you for listening.
